/*
Q18. Create a base class called shape. Use this class to store two double type values that could be used to
compute the area of figures. Derive two specific classes called triangle and rectangle from base shape. Add
to the base class, a member function get_data() to initialize base class data members and another member
function display_area() to compute and display the area of figures. Make display_area() as a virtual function
and redefine this function in the derived class to suit their requirements. Using these three classes, design a
program that will accept dimensions of a triangle or a rectangle interactively and display the area. Remember
the two values given as input will be treated as lengths of
two sides in the case of rectangles and as base and height in the case of triangle and used as follows:
Area of rectangle = x * y
Area of triangle = Â½ *x*y
